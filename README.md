## Idea

The idea of the application is to transform a text file that I used for planning...

```txt
Monday (date)
- task
- task
- task

Tuesday (date)
- task
- task
- task

Wednesday (date)
- task
- task
- task

Thursday (date)
- task
...
...
...

Backlog
- task
- task
- task
  description
...
```

To the interface, for automatization of calendar generating, history of tasks and backlog for future tasks:
