## Idea

The idea of the application is to transform a text file that I used for planning...

```txt
Monday (date)
- task
- task
- task

Tuesday (date)
- task
- task
- task

Wednesday (date)
- task
- task
- task

Thursday (date)
- task
...
...
...

Backlog
- task
- task
- task
  description
...
```

To the interface, for automatization of calendar generating, history of tasks and backlog for future tasks:

<table>
  <tr>
  <td>
    <img src="./public/screenshots/desktop.jpg" alt="todo.it - another todo app but with features" />
  </td>
  <td>
    <img src="./public/screenshots/mobile.jpg" alt="todo.it - another todo app but with features" />
  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Features

- Automatic calendar generating
- Last 2 month tasks history
- Backlog for future tasks
- Drag'n'drop tasks
- Copy tasks

## For developers
### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

#### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Take a look other commands in `package.json`
